				My name is Shanya Williams. I play volleyball and basketball. On my free time I like to sleep and watch TV.  Lately I haven't been able to do either of these things due to so much work from school. I also really like to play sports and be active. I go to Oakland Technical High School and am a part of multiple communities. Some of them are Girls Inc, Youth Radio, Graphic Design, Paideia, volleyball team, basketball team, and my school's Black Student Union club.

			I have been going to Oaklnad Technical High School (Tech) since the beginnign of my high school years. I am a junior so I am almost done and not only am I proud of myself but am extremely tired and drained out. I think senioritis has already hit me. One program that I am a part of is the graphic design class. Although the title is graphic design, we do many things and experiment with many mediums. This is my second year being in this program and this class is the only reason why I actually like going to school.

			I didn't jump right into the Youth Radio Interactive Department. First, I started out as a freshmen in the Core program at Youth Radio (YR) then I moved to the Bridge program. In Core I learned about the three core skills that YR is mainly focussed on- Journalism, music, and multimedia. In Bridge I then began to proceed with one of those areas which was multimedia and built up my skills there. Once I became an intern in the YRI department I learned to code and learn how to tell stories through the code.

			I have been a part of Girls Inc for about 10 years- since first grade. For my 8th grade I started out as a rookie. This year I took classes that were based around community building because this is the year were I was forced to meet new people. The next year I was a vet and I took more classes that started to lean towards college and then became an intern 1 and 2 my sophmore year and had to intern somewhere. I chose Youth Radio. Now I am in the next stage and it's called CAN! and this is all about making sure I get into  college. Throughout this program it is not all business. We do sisterhood activities and go on field trips like college tours.

					Last year we went on a college tour to UC Davis and I loved the campus. They had a river going through it but I guess the seasons made the river get covered with this green stuff from the trees.

					One of the field trips that I went on was kayaking. I went during my vet year and it was probably the most exhausting field trip I have ever been on. I got extremely wet and we went at a time when the wind was strong so all of my arms became week from paddling so hard.

					At the end of each summer, Girls Inc gathers all the girls to celebrate their completion of their first summer in a higher stage then the last.  There is food and also little projects we worked on during the summer with slide shows. This is overall the happiest time of the whole summer becuase this is the day where we get out stipens for our hard work.
